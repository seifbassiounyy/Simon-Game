# Simon-Game-Arduino

## Overview

This is an implementation of simon game using Arduino IDE. Components used are Arduino Uno, joystick, and a few 4 LEDs. As the game starts, the LEDs light up in a certain sequence, and user is supposed to track and follow the same sequence using the joystick to move on to the next level. As the game starts, user chooses difficulty level which indicates how fast the lamps toggle sequentially. Only one LED toggles at the beginning, then the number of LED toggles increases as the user keep guessing sequence correctly.
